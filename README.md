# Titanic-Competition
This repository contains code and resources for predicting survival on the Titanic. It's part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques. 

# Dataset: The dataset consists of two files:
train.csv: Contains data for training the model.<br>
test.csv: Contains data for testing the model.

# Files:
titanic.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.<br>
submission.csv: CSV file containing predictions generated by the model on the test set.<br>
README.md: This file, provides an overview of the repository.

# Results:
The model achieves an accuracy of 78% on the test set.
